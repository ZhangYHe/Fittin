## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Today's Workout Hero Card
The system MUST provide a prominent hero card on the Home Dashboard that displays the scheduled workout derived from the currently selected active plan instance, including the active plan's current week position, current day position, primary lift, and exercise count.

#### Scenario: User views the dashboard
- **WHEN** the user opens the app and arrives at the Home Dashboard
- **THEN** a large card displaying the current workout title, current plan `week`, current plan `day`, lead lift, and number of exercises from the active plan is visible at the top instead of hardcoded demo content.

#### Scenario: User switches active plans
- **WHEN** the user changes the active plan from the plan library
- **THEN** the hero card updates to the selected plan instance’s scheduled workout without requiring an app restart
- **AND** the displayed week/day position reflects the newly active plan instance.

### Requirement: Seamless Session Launch
The system MUST allow users to tap the hero card to smoothly transition into the Active Session Screen with the full multi-exercise workout context loaded or resumed.

#### Scenario: User starts the daily workout
- **WHEN** the user taps the "Today's Workout" hero card
- **THEN** an elegant transition animation takes the user to the `ActiveSessionScreen` with the scheduled workout's ordered exercises, pre-filled set targets, and any in-progress draft entries loaded.
